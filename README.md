# Lighty - The Light Overlay Mod with a twist!

## About Supported Minecraft Versions

Because of time restraints I am only able to bring features to *the most recent Minecraft version*.

If you come across any bugs in other versions, just open an issue and I will look into fixing it.

All of the above boils down to these rules:

- I will support the current stable Minecraft version.
- If there is demand for a feature to be backported **AND** the backport is straightforward (read: easy to do), I may consider backporting that feature. Just open an issue about it.
- I will try to support the most recent snapshot. I will not backport any changes to snapshots.
- Support for any other version may or may not be provided.

That said, PRs of any kind are more than welcome! If it is anything big, consider opening an issue first or contacting me.               

## Differences across Minecraft versions

There may be slight differences between the same Lighty version (for example, `v1.1.0+1.18.2` and `v1.1.0+1.19.3`) because of technical changes. The core feature set (the light overlays) should work similarly though.
